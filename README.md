assignment 1 - 
we were given a target hash.
taking any string as input, and the appending a new number.
i imported the library timeit to note the time it took for finding the nonce which would give the hash less than the target hash.
also, i used the int function, which converted the the 16 sized hash, and compared them in the condition required in while loop.
increasing the number by 1, and appending the number in string until we get the required hash which is less than the target function.
